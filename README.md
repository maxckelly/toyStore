# README

This is my Rails project building a toyStore. Its one of my first Rails project, where I play around with the controllers, forms, models, database and routes. I haven't focused on this app visually as it is a way for me to get a better understanding of how Rails works and how I can break and fix things. 

If you have any question please reach out.
